Renters everywhere have had an experience where it was cumbersome to pay rent, schedule maintenance appointments, or simply communicate with management or other tenants. We believe this is unacceptable in modern day, high tech society where everybody has a computer in their pocket. We ultimately aim to make communication between tenant and management as easy and fast as possible by providing a fully featured application where tenants can schedule maintenance appointments, pay rent, and communicate with other tenants and management. Moreover, this application will allow management to more easily manage rental properties and tenants.
